# CS210-CPP

- This project required building an inventory processing program. It required a file to be read, collated, and output in addition to allowing for various inventory views.

- The output is formatted in a way that makes the menu options and results easy to read. The input verification for menu functionality works particularly well in that it allows for both intentional and unintentional incorrect input without causing program failure.

- I feel I could broaden my use of classes and methods in order to reduce code written in main. This program has a significant amount of code in main.

- I originally struggled with sorting the items from the inventory file into matching data. I attempted to make class items with a name and count where the count could increase, but learned that using a map would be easier. Mapping was introduced in my textbook for the course, but I also utilized stack overflow to learn how to correctly iterate over the map with a loop and how to search within the map.

- The project required me to step out of my knowledge base and seek a resolution to a problem I couldn't solve with my current set of tools. Being able to work with outside resources and learning through working seem to be necessary skills in programming.

- In addition to using comments to note sections of a loop and methods being called, the program functions with both a map and array of class items. Each can easily be updated. In hindsight, I would prefer to make allow the user to select their input and output files of choice for confirming and organizing the inventory. This would make this program slightly more adaptable.
